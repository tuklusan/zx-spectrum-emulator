# ZX Spectrum 48K — Live in Your Browser

[**▶ Launch the live ZX Spectrum 48K emulator**](https://tuklusan.github.io/zx-spectrum-emulator/)

This repository is a fork of Chris Wilson's original `zx-spectrum-emulator` project, with the live GitHub Pages build presenting the current combined codebase. Run it directly in a modern browser, with TAP and standard-speed TZX tape support, SNA/Z80 snapshots, RZX playback, Sinclair BASIC tools, and the built-in Z80 debugger and rewind workbench.

## Other ZX Spectrum Projects

- [**Warajevo ZX Spectrum Next**](https://github.com/tuklusan/warajevo-zx-spectrum-next) — an active, architecture-led effort to build a modern, portable continuation of the Warajevo emulator. The repository currently contains the Phase-0/bootstrap C11/CMake implementation scaffold, validation gates, remote test harnesses, and the design authorities that define the intended emulator architecture.

- [**ZX-UX — The ZX Spectrum 48K Unix Project**](https://github.com/tuklusan/ZX-UX-The-ZX-Spectrum-48K-Unix-Project) — a Unix-like development environment being engineered for the original unexpanded 48K ZX Spectrum: one Z80, 48K of RAM, cassette persistence, dense 64-column text, cooperative tasks, and a native toolchain, developed in explicit evidence-backed phases.

## Computing Blog

[**Supratim Sanyal's Computing Blog — Wandering Digital Wastelands as a Geek**](https://supratim-sanyal.blogspot.com/) is a long-running notebook of computing discoveries, experiments, and things worth documenting so they do not have to be reinvented later. Recent work covers AI-agent software development, model and coding-harness experiments, cross-platform engineering on Linux, macOS and Windows, GitHub Actions and CI debugging, browser-delivered software, and detailed engineering post-mortems.

# Z80 Machine Lab

A faithful Zilog Z80 emulator with four browser-hosted machine layers:

- a ZX Spectrum 48K emulator for teaching Z80 assembly and Sinclair BASIC.
- a bootable CP/M 2.2 machine using z80pack-compatible disk and console I/O.
- a TRS-80 Model III-compatible machine layer for ROM BASIC and cassette
  software experiments.
- a TI-85-like calculator machine layer with a clickable faceplate, RAM LCD
  rendering, and optional user-supplied ROM loading.

## Current Status

The Z80 CPU core is implemented and strongly validated:

- Complete base, CB, ED, DD, FD, DDCB, and FDCB opcode decoder coverage.
- Documented and major undocumented Z80 behaviours implemented, including
  X/Y flag quirks, `WZ/MEMPTR`, `Q`, indexed instructions, block operations,
  and interrupt entry paths.
- Strict SingleStep validation passes 1,604,000 instruction vectors, including
  registers, flags, memory, ports, cycles, `WZ`, and `Q`.
- `zexdoc.com` and `zexall.com` both pass through the CP/M exerciser harness.

The first ZX Spectrum 48K machine layer is in place:

- `Spectrum48` maps a 16K ROM at `0x0000-0x3fff` and 48K RAM at
  `0x4000-0xffff`.
- Port `0xfe` implements active-low keyboard row reads plus border and beeper
  state writes.
- Beeper transitions are captured with CPU t-state timing and can be played in
  the browser through Web Audio.
- A 50 Hz frame loop raises maskable interrupts and renders the ULA display file
  plus border into a 320x240 RGBA frame.
- The browser viewer loads the bundled `ROM/48.rom`, runs the ROM, accepts
  modern PC keyboard input, and can paste/load Sinclair BASIC listings.
- The viewer includes a visual debugger with pause/frame-step/instruction-step
  and reverse-step controls, a scrub-able rewind timeline, live registers and
  flags, disassembly around `PC`,
  BASIC status, memory inspectors for key Spectrum regions, always-visible
  raster line/t-state readouts, an optional raster overlay, and immediate screen
  redraws while stepping.
- Continuous execution and RZX playback are captured into a bounded 64 MB
  reverse-delta history of up to 6,000 checkpoints, avoiding a full 48K copy
  for every frame while still allowing roughly two minutes of frame rewind.
- The debugger workbench exposes independently resizable screen, register,
  disassembly, memory, source-listing, and assembler-reference panels. Each
  panel can remain docked, float and be dragged with its layout persisted, or
  mirror live state into a separately resizable browser window. Source
  listings with hexadecimal address prefixes follow the current `PC`, while the
  categorized searchable reference covers common sjasmplus directives,
  expressions, output formats, debugging features, and functions and links to
  the complete versioned documentation.
- `.tap` files and standard-speed `.tzx` blocks can be parsed in the browser,
  inspected as tape blocks, and fast-loaded for BASIC program and CODE
  header/data pairs.
- `.z80` and classic 48K `.sna` snapshots can be loaded and the current machine
  state can be saved as an uncompressed 48K `.z80` snapshot for returning to
  BASIC programs or game positions later.
- `.rzx` input recordings can be stepped frame-by-frame or played continuously
  using their recorded opcode-fetch counts and port input values. Compressed and
  uncompressed 48K recordings with embedded or user-supplied external `.z80`
  and `.sna` snapshots are supported, including each input block's initial
  t-state counter. Protected recordings and snapshots for other machine
  profiles are rejected with an explicit diagnostic.
- The 48K ULA model exposes display fetches on the floating bus, applies the
  display-memory contention pattern across instruction memory accesses, and
  maps raster coordinates onto the visible 320x240 frame for the debugger
  overlay.
- The BASIC source paths tokenize and detokenize the full 48K keyword range,
  renumber listings that exceed line `9999`, auto-run pasted listings, export
  editable `.bas` files, and handle ROM-specific `DEF FN` parameter
  placeholders.

The CP/M 2.2 page is also bootable and can switch hardware profiles:

- `Cpm22Machine` owns 64K RAM, the shared Z80 CPU, z80pack-compatible console
  ports, and z80pack/cpmsim floppy disk controller ports.
- `ROM/cpm22-1.dsk` boots through its real boot sector and BIOS into CP/M 2.2,
  reaching the normal `A>` prompt without BDOS interception.
- `ROM/cpm22-2.dsk` is bundled as the matching upstream z80pack companion disk
  and is mounted as C: by default.
- `Z80Mbc2Machine` emulates the Z80-MBC2 IOS protocol and boots
  `ROM/DS0N00.DSK` natively, with `DS0N00.DSK` through `DS0N06.DSK` mounted as
  A: through G: when that profile is selected.
- The browser CP/M page defaults to the z80pack profile, mounting the bundled
  system disk as A: and a blank writable work disk as B:.
- Whole-disk load/save and individual CP/M file import/download/delete are
  available from the browser.
- `Save Session` downloads a compressed local ZIP containing CPU state, RAM,
  terminal state, active profile, and the mounted disk images; `Load Session`
  restores that ZIP without using any server-side storage.
- A compact CP/M debug drawer shows live CPU registers, flags, PC disassembly,
  disk/controller state, console queue status, and a reserved recent-call trace
  panel for future BIOS/BDOS tracing.
- The CP/M file utility handles the z80pack skewed 8-inch floppy layout,
  Z80-MBC2 8 MB disk images for foreign-disk imports, multi-extent files, and
  repair of old full-extent imports whose record counts were written
  incorrectly.
- The terminal renderer is an 80x24 screen buffer with WordStar/Soroc-style
  cursor addressing, screen clear, erase-to-end-of-line, scrolling, tabs, and
  control-byte filtering.

The TRS-80 Model III layer is separate from both Spectrum and CP/M:

- `Trs80Model3Machine` maps a 14K Model III ROM at `0x0000-0x37ff`,
  memory-mapped keyboard rows at `0x3800-0x3bff`, 1K of 64x16 text video RAM at
  `0x3c00-0x3fff`, and 48K RAM at `0x4000-0xffff`.
- The browser page loads the bundled Model III ROM, accepts plain text typing
  and paste as simulated key taps, and includes quick startup prompt buttons for
  `H`, `L`, and Enter.
- `.cas` support covers Level II BASIC programs and TRS-80 `SYSTEM`
  machine-code tapes. BASIC entries are relocated into the ROM BASIC program
  area; SYSTEM entries are loaded into their recorded addresses and jump to the
  tape entry point.
- `Save Session` and `Load Session` use a local JSON file containing CPU state,
  RAM, video RAM, keyboard state, frame count, and cassette cursor metadata.
- The compact debug drawer shows live registers, flags, disassembly, keyboard
  state, display state, frame count, and cassette playback state.
- Model III disk support, Model I compatibility, and Model 4 profiles remain
  future layers.

The TI-85-like calculator layer is also separate from Spectrum, CP/M, and
TRS-80:

- `Ti85Machine` maps fixed and banked ROM, 32K RAM, keypad matrix ports, ON-key
  interrupt state, LCD control ports, and the RAM-backed 128x64 monochrome LCD.
- The browser page has an original calculator-style faceplate with clickable
  keys, responsive desktop/mobile sizing, a compact debug drawer, and golden
  workflow tests for representative calculator input paths.
- `ROM/TI85.ROM` is optional. When it is not present, the page still loads and
  explains that the user must provide their own legally obtained TI-85 ROM file
  before the compatible machine can boot.
- Texas Instruments and TI-85 are referenced only to describe compatibility.
  The demo is independent, unaffiliated, and uses original emulator/UI code and
  assets rather than TI logos, product artwork, source code, or ROM contents.

See [CPU Status](docs/cpu-status.md), [Validation](docs/validation.md),
[Architecture](docs/architecture.md), and the
[CP/M Browser Guide](docs/cpm22-browser-guide.md) for details and caveats.

## Quick Validation

```sh
npm test
npm run coverage:opcodes
```

Quick CP/M boot smoke test from Node:

```sh
npm run run:cpm22
```

## Browser Apps

With `ROM/48.rom` and `ROM/cpm22-1.dsk` present, start the local static server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The first page is a
machine selector with links to:

- `spectrum.html` for the ZX Spectrum 48K app.
- `cpm.html` for the CP/M 2.2 terminal app.
- `trs80.html` for the TRS-80 Model III app.
- `ti85.html` for the TI-85-like calculator app.

The Spectrum viewer loads the 48K ROM, runs the headless machine, draws the
320x240 border/display frame, and passes browser key events into the Spectrum
keyboard matrix.

`ROM/48.rom` is included so the browser demo can boot without extra setup. The
emulator code is MIT licensed; the ROM image is not part of that code license.
See [ROM/README.md](ROM/README.md) for the ROM notice.

The `Paste BASIC` box accepts normal PC text. Numbered listings are loaded
directly into BASIC memory and then `RUN` is typed automatically unless the
paste includes unnumbered commands. Listings with line numbers above the real
Spectrum editor limit are renumbered before loading.

The `BASIC Source` controls load `.bas` or plain-text listings directly from
disk using the same tokenizer as paste loading. `Export BASIC` reads the current
program from `PROG` to `VARS`, detokenizes Spectrum keyword bytes, skips hidden
numeric markers, and downloads editable text as `zx-spectrum-program.bas`.

The `Load TAP` panel accepts `.tap` and `.tzx` files. TAP containers and
standard-speed TZX data blocks are parsed into header/data blocks, showing block
name, type, length, checksum status, and whether the entry can be loaded by the
current fast-load path. Parsed files are also mounted as a virtual tape for the
Spectrum ROM loader. BASIC program entries are copied directly to the ROM BASIC
program area and auto-start with `RUN <line>` when the header contains an
auto-start line; later ROM `LOAD "" CODE` calls made by that loader are
satisfied from the mounted blocks in order. CODE entries can also be copied
directly to the start address from the header. When a loader drops into tape
polling instead of the ROM byte-loader entry point, standard-speed tape blocks
are played as EAR pulses on port `0xfe`. Array blocks, turbo/pure-data TZX
blocks, and more exact custom-loader timing are later work.

During pulse playback, flashing border colours are expected: that is the loader
polling the tape input. Large standard-speed blocks load at cassette speed, so a
50K-ish block can take around two minutes to finish.

The `Snapshots` panel accepts `.z80` files. Loading a snapshot restores the
Z80 registers, interrupt state, border colour, and all 48K RAM. Version 1
snapshots are supported with compressed or uncompressed RAM; extended snapshots
are supported when they contain the normal 48K pages. `Save Z80 Snapshot`
downloads the current emulator state as an uncompressed version 1 `.z80` file.
This is the most convenient way to save a BASIC program or a game position in
the browser: it preserves the whole machine state, not just the BASIC listing.

The CP/M page defaults to the z80pack profile: A: is the bundled system disk,
B: is a blank work disk, and C: is the z80pack companion disk. Use the machine
profile control to switch to Z80-MBC2, which boots `DS0N00.DSK` and mounts
`DS0N00.DSK` through `DS0N06.DSK` as A: through G:. In the Z80-MBC2 profile,
F: and G: are labelled as work/scratch disks and changes to those drives are
saved to the user's browser-local IndexedDB storage. Nothing is written back to
GitHub; whole-disk downloads remain the portable per-disk backup path. For a
full resume point, `Save Session` downloads a compressed `.zip` containing RAM,
CPU registers, terminal screen state, active CP/M profile, selected controls,
and all mounted disk bytes. `Load Session` restores that ZIP locally in the
browser, so it works on GitHub Pages without accounts, uploads, or repository
writes. The file panel can import host files into a selected CP/M drive,
download CP/M files back to the host, and delete files. The disk controls can
load or save a whole `.dsk` image for the selected drive, restore a drive to its
bundled image, or clear local browser disk changes. The Foreign Disk panel can
still load Z80-MBC2 8 MB disk images, list their directories, and copy selected
files into the currently selected CP/M drive. The Debug Drawer below the terminal
mirrors the Spectrum debugger at CP/M scale: it shows registers, flags,
disassembly at `PC`, z80pack FDC or Z80-MBC2 IOS disk state, console queue
counts, and a placeholder for later BIOS/BDOS call tracing. See
[CP/M Browser Guide](docs/cpm22-browser-guide.md) for the exact workflow.

The TRS-80 page boots the bundled Model III ROM and starts at the cassette
speed prompt. Use `H`, `L`, and Enter to reach `READY`, or paste plain text into
the Type box to simulate normal key taps into ROM BASIC. The cassette panel can
mount `.cas` files. Level II BASIC tapes show as `BASIC` entries and can be
fast-loaded into BASIC RAM. Machine-code tapes show as `SYSTEM` entries and can
be fast-loaded to their recorded addresses with `Load SYSTEM`, which also sets
the CPU `PC` to the cassette entry point. The Play and Stop buttons keep the
raw mounted CAS bytes available as cassette input pulses for ROM-loader paths.
`Save Session` downloads a JSON snapshot of the TRS-80 machine state, and
`Load Session` restores it locally in the browser.

The TI-85-like page attempts to load `ROM/TI85.ROM` if that file exists. That
ROM is not required for the static app to load and is not redistributed by this
project; without it, the page shows an in-app notice asking the user to supply a
legally obtained TI-85 ROM file. With a compatible ROM loaded, the calculator
faceplate sends screen clicks through the keypad matrix and the LCD canvas is
rendered from the machine's RAM-backed display buffer.

## GitHub Pages Demo

The browser app is static and can be published with GitHub Pages. The app uses
relative module and asset paths so it works both at `localhost:3000` and under a
project Pages URL such as:

```text
https://chriswilson2020.github.io/zx-spectrum-emulator/
```

Build the deployable static tree locally with:

```sh
npm run build:pages
```

This writes `dist/` with `index.html`, `spectrum.html`, `cpm.html`,
`trs80.html`, `ti85.html`, `public/`, `src/`, and `ROM/` when the ROM directory
is present. Optional private ROM files such as `ROM/TI85.ROM` are not required
for the Pages build; the TI-85-like page handles their absence in the browser.
The workflow in
`.github/workflows/pages.yml` runs the unit suite, builds `dist/`, uploads it as
a Pages artifact, and deploys it when changes land on `main` or when the
workflow is run manually. In GitHub, set
`Settings -> Pages -> Build and deployment -> Source` to `GitHub Actions`.

The debugger is designed for the browser viewport rather than as a fixed-size
desktop panel. On wide screens the Spectrum display remains in the left pane
with a compact machine console on the right. Secondary tools are grouped into
tabs for BASIC, Tape, Snapshots, and Debug, while the detailed register,
disassembly, BASIC, and memory views live in a collapsible Debug Workbench below
the display. The canvas starts scaling down before the layout becomes cramped,
and below tablet widths the console and workbench stack into a single column.

The long independent Z80 exercisers are available too:

```sh
npm run test:zexdoc
npm run test:zexall
```

These are intentionally heavy runs. Each currently executes about 5.76 billion
emulated Z80 instructions.

The strict SingleStep suite is supported but its vector corpus is intentionally
not committed because it is very large. To run it locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SingleStepTests/z80 vendor/SingleStepTests-z80
npm run test:singlestep
```

## License

The emulator code is licensed under the MIT License. See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

Third-party validation material under `ZEXALL-main/` is GPLv2-licensed and is
kept separate from the emulator runtime. The bundled CP/M disk image comes from
Udo Munk's MIT-licensed z80pack project. See
[THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) for details.

## CP/M Exerciser Harness

The CPU can run CP/M-style `.COM` validation programs through a small BDOS
console harness. This workspace includes `zexdoc.com` and `zexall.com` under
`ZEXALL-main/`.

```sh
npm run test:zexdoc
npm run test:zexall
```

The harness loads the program at `0x0100`, intercepts `CALL 0x0005`, supports
BDOS console output functions `2` and `9`, and terminates on BDOS function `0`
or CP/M warm boot at `0x0000`.

## Goal

The emulator is being built as a small lab for Z80 machines: a faithful ZX
Spectrum emulator, a browser-bootable CP/M machine, a TRS-80 Model III machine,
and a TI-85-like calculator target, plus a teaching environment for Z80
assembly, Sinclair BASIC, ROM BASIC, calculator workflows, and classic 8-bit
systems. The immediate next engineering milestones are deeper per-memory-cycle
Spectrum contention and border timing, TRS-80 display/cassette polish, TI-85
compatibility tests, and later TRS-80 disk support.

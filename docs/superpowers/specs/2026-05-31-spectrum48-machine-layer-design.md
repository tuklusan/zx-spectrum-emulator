# Spectrum48 Machine Layer Design

## Goal

Build the first headless ZX Spectrum 48K machine wrapper around the validated
Z80 core so real 48K ROM bytes can be mapped, fetched, and executed through a
Spectrum-shaped memory and I/O boundary.

## Scope

This slice creates a `Spectrum48` class with ROM/RAM mapping, CPU ownership,
basic I/O hooks, a frame-sized run helper, keyboard matrix support, initial
display rendering, first-pass Web Audio beeper output, and a visual browser
debugger. It includes first-pass TAP/TZX loading and standard-speed EAR pulse
playback, but does not model contention, snapshot formats, turbo tape blocks, or
tape audio output yet.

## Architecture

`Spectrum48` owns a `Z80` instance and exposes the memory object expected by the
CPU. The class maps a 16K ROM at `0x0000-0x3fff` and 48K RAM at
`0x4000-0xffff`. ROM writes are ignored, while RAM writes update the backing
RAM array.

The machine also supplies basic I/O callbacks to the CPU. For this milestone,
port `0xfe` reads return active-low keyboard matrix rows and writes update
border colour and beeper state fields. This gives later audio and timing work a
stable place to attach without changing the CPU core.

## Public API

- `new Spectrum48({ rom })`: create a machine from a 16K byte array.
- `Spectrum48.fromRomFile(path)`: load a 16K ROM from disk.
- `read8(address)`, `write8(address, value)`, `read16(address)`, `write16(address, value)`: memory map access.
- `readPort(port)`, `writePort(port, value)`: machine I/O access.
- `step()`: execute one CPU instruction.
- `runTStates(targetTStates)`: run instructions until at least the requested cycle count has elapsed.
- `runFrame()`: run one 50 Hz PAL frame worth of CPU time and request a maskable interrupt.
- `reset()`: reset the CPU and frame counter while preserving ROM/RAM contents.
- `pressKey(key)`, `releaseKey(key)`, `getPressedKeys()`: update and inspect the Spectrum keyboard matrix.
- `renderDisplayRgba(options)`, `renderFrameRgba(options)`: render the Spectrum display file and border.

## Browser Debugger

The viewer includes a visual debugger intended for iterative emulator work and
teaching. It exposes run/pause, frame-step, and instruction-step controls, plus
live register pairs, flags, interrupt mode, T-state count, BASIC status, system
variable pointers, a conservative disassembly window around `PC`, and memory
panels for important Spectrum regions.

The layout keeps the Spectrum display in the left pane and controls in a right
rail on desktop-width screens. The display scales down before it overlaps the
right rail, and debugger cards reflow through named grid areas for medium and
narrow screens.

## Tape Loader

The browser UI includes a `.tap`/`.tzx` file picker. The parser reads TAP blocks
and standard-speed TZX data blocks, validates checksums, decodes Spectrum
headers, and pairs each header with the following data block when present. BASIC
program pairs are loaded into the BASIC program area and can auto-start from the
header line number. CODE pairs are loaded to the start address from the header.
Parsed tape blocks are mounted as a virtual tape, and the machine intercepts the
48K ROM byte loader at `0x0556` so ordinary ROM `LOAD "" CODE` calls can consume
later blocks in sequence. Remaining standard-speed blocks can also be expanded
into pilot/sync/data pulses and exposed through the EAR bit on port `0xfe`.
Number arrays, character arrays, TZX turbo/pure-data blocks, and tougher custom
loader timing remain out of scope for this slice.

## Testing

Tests cover ROM size validation, ROM reads, ignored ROM writes, RAM
reads/writes, little-endian 16-bit access across the machine map, loading
`ROM/48.rom`, CPU fetching through the machine memory callbacks, port `0xfe`
state, keyboard rows, frame stepping, display rendering, browser keyboard
translation, BASIC paste loading, Web Audio sample generation, and debugger
formatting/disassembly/status helpers, plus TAP/TZX parsing and BASIC/CODE
fast-loading.

## Open Follow-Ups

- Add breakpoints and richer disassembly coverage.
- Add array block loading, turbo/pure-data TZX blocks, and tougher custom-loader
  compatibility.
- Improve beeper timing and filtering beyond the first Web Audio buffer output.
- Add ULA contention once the basic machine loop works.
